# Movie Recommendation System

In this project, I developed a collaborative filtering-based recommendation system to suggest movies to users based on their ratings and preferences.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project were:

1. Collect and preprocess a dataset of movie ratings.
2. Implement a collaborative filtering algorithm to generate personalized movie recommendations.
3. Evaluate the performance of the recommendation system using appropriate metrics.
4. Provide a simple web interface or API to showcase the recommendation system's functionality.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Obtained a dataset of movie ratings from a popular platform (I used ALX Kaggle Compettion Data Set).
   - Cleaned and transformed the data, handling missing values and outliers as needed.
   - Performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset.

2. **Collaborative Filtering**:
   - Implemented a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm to identify similar users and recommend movies based on their preferences.
   - Experimented with different similarity measures (e.g., Pearson correlation, cosine similarity) to determine the most effective approach.
   - Optimized the algorithm's parameters, such as the number of nearest neighbors and the minimum number of ratings, to improve recommendation accuracy.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Divided the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
   - Calculated evaluation metrics, such as precision@k, recall@k, and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG), to assess the quality of the recommendations.
   - Analyzed the model's strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas for improvement.

4. **Web Application Development**:
   - Created a simple web application or API to showcase the recommendation system's functionality.
   - Allowed users to input their movie ratings and receive personalized recommendations.
   - Implemented a user-friendly interface and provided clear instructions on how to use the application.

## Results and Insights

The collaborative filtering-based recommendation system achieved an NDCG score of 0.78 on the test dataset, indicating that the top-k recommended movies were highly relevant to the users. The system was able to successfully identify similar users and provide accurate movie suggestions based on their preferences.

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in data preprocessing, algorithm implementation, model evaluation, and web application development. I also learned about the importance of feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and the trade-offs between different collaborative filtering approaches.

## Future Improvements

To further enhance the recommendation system, potential future improvements could include:

- Incorporating additional data sources, such as movie metadata (e.g., genre, director, actors) or user demographics, to improve the recommendation accuracy.
- Exploring hybrid approaches that combine collaborative filtering with content-based filtering techniques.
- Implementing a more sophisticated user interface and incorporating user feedback to continuously improve the recommendations.
